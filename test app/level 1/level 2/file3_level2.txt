Problem modeling
- N queen board are modeled as an 𝑁 × 𝑁 matrix
- Main thread creates 𝑁 threads or 𝑁/𝑥 (where 𝑥 is number of processors) that explore solution space for the 
board.
o Each thread will start given the position of the queen in the first row
o For large 𝑁, a thread may handle to branches of the Graph the modeled the search space
GUI:
- Input
o 𝑁 board dimension 
- Output
o Board(s) showing search space exploration for solution 
- Note: GUI should be updated in real time.
